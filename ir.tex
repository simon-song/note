\section{Day count conventions}

We give the formula for calculating year fraction between two days $d_1$ and
$d_2$ given two reference dates $d_3$ and $d_4$, using the Actual/Actual ICMA
convention.

\begin{equation}
  YF(d_1,d_2) = \frac{Days(d_1,d_2)}{f \times Days(d_3, d_4)},
\end{equation}
here $f$ is the payment frequency. If $f$ is not specified, it can be estimated
by
\begin{equation}
  f = \frac{12.0}{Integer(0.5 + 12 * (d_2 - d_1) / 365.0)}.
\end{equation}

If reference dates $d_3$ and $d_4$ are not given, we can usually set $d_3=d_1$
and $d_4=d_2$, and the year fraction formula becomes
\begin{equation}
  YF(d_1,d_2) = \frac{Days(d_1,d_2)}{f \times Days(d_1, d_2)}
              = \frac{1}{f}.
\end{equation}

\section{Prototypical Coupon Bond}
A prototypical coupon bond is a contract that pays at dates 
$\{T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_{n}\}$ the amounts of $\{c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_n\}$. Typically
the cashflows are defined as $c_i=N\delta_i K$ for $i<n$, and 
$c_n=N\delta_n K+N$ where $K$ is a fixed coupon rate, $N$ is the face value,
and $\delta_j$ be the year fraction between dates $T_{j-1}$ and $T_{j}$,

\section{Prototypical floating-rate note}
A prototypical floating-rate note pays at dates
$\{T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_{n}\}$ the LIBOR rates that reset at previous dates
$\{T_0,T_1,\cdots,T_{n-1}\}$, plus the notional on $T_n$.

\section{Interest Rate Swaps}
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two counterparties
to exchange a series of cashflows on pre-agreed dates in the future (see Figure
\ref{F:swap}). In general the payment frequencies of the fixed and floating legs
are different. A payer's swap pays fixed rate $K$ and receives the floating rate, 
while a receiver's swap pays floating rate and receives fixed rate.

Let $\{T_0,T_1,\cdots,T_{n-1}\}$ be the reset dates, and
$\{T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_{n}\}$ be the payment dates of the floating leg, and
$\{S_0,S_1,\cdots,S_{m-1}\}$ be the reset dates, and
$\{S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_{n}\}$ be the payment dates of the fixed leg. 
Let $\delta^S_j$ be the year fraction between dates $S_{j-1}$ and $S_{j}$,
and let $\delta^T_{j}$ be the year fraction between dates $T_{j-1}$ and 
$T_{j}$. For a payer's swap, the payoff at time $T_j$ is
\[
  \delta^T_j L_{T_{j-1}}[T_{j-1},T_j]  \qquad j=1,2,\cdots,n
\]
and at the time $S_j$, the payoff is
\[
  - \delta^S_j K  \qquad j=1,2,\cdots,m.
\]

      -- (7,-1) node[below] {$\delta^S_{m}K$} ;
  \end{tikzpicture} 
  \caption{A payer's swap pays fixed and receives floating rate. Here we use
           abbreviation $L_j$ for $L_j[T_j,T_{j+1}]$. In this example the
           floating leg pays twice as frequent as the fixed leg, i.e. $n=2m$.}
  \label{F:swap}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The price of the fixed leg at time $t<T_0$ is
\[
  K \sum_{j=1}^m \delta^S_j D_{tS_j},
\]
while the price of the floating leg is simply
\[
  \sum_{j=1}^n \delta^T_j L_{T_{j-1}}[T_{j-1},T_j] D_{tT_j}
    = D_{tT_0} - D_{tT_n}.
\]
And the price of a payer's swap is the difference between the floating leg and
the fixed leg:
\begin{equation}
  PFS(t,\{T_j\}_{j\le n},\{S_j\}_{j\le m},K)
    = D_{tT_0} - D_{tT_n} - K\sum_{j=1}^m \delta^S_j D_{tS_j}.
\end{equation}
Similarly the price of a receiver's swap equals the fixed leg substracts the
floating leg:
\begin{equation}
  RFS(t,\{T_j\}_{j\le n},\{S_j\}_{j\le m},K)
    = -D_{tT_0} + D_{tT_n} + K\sum_{j=1}^m \delta^S_j D_{tS_j}.
\end{equation}


The par swap rate is the fixed rate of the swap such that the swap is at the 
money, i.e.
\begin{equation} \label{E:swap}
  y_n(t) \equiv y(t,\{T_j\}_{j\le n},\{S_j\}_{j\le m}) 
    = \frac{ D_{tT_0} - D_{tT_n} }{ \sum_{j=1}^m \delta^S_j D_{tS_j} },
\end{equation}

\section{Caps and Floors}
An interest rate cap is made up of a series of caplets. 
\marginnote{Cap}
Let $\{T_0,T_1,\cdots,T_{n-1}\}$ be the reset dates, and
$\{T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_{n}\}$ be the payment dates of the cap, 
and let $\delta_{j}$ be the year fraction between dates $T_{j-1}$ and $T_j$.
At time $T_j,j=1,2,\cdots n$, the payoff is
\begin{equation} \label{E:cap}
  \delta_j \left( L_{T_{j-1}}[T_{j-1},T_j] - K \right)_+,
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the strike for the cap (see Figure \ref{F:cap}).

    Equation \ref{E:cap}.}
  \label{F:cap}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Similarly an interest rate floor is made up of a series of floorets. 
\marginnote{Floor}
Let $\{T_0,T_1,\cdots,T_{n-1}\}$ be the reset dates, and
$\{T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_{n}\}$ be the payment dates of the floor, 
and let $\delta_{j}$ be the year fraction between dates $T_{j-1}$ and $T_j$.
At time $T_j,j=1,2,\cdots n$, the payoff is
\begin{equation} \label{E:cap}
  \delta_j \left( K - L_{T_{j-1}}[T_{j-1},T_j] \right)_+,
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the strike for the floor.
